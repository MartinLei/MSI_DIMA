# Exercises 1: Forward, Backward Chaining or Constraint Satisfaction Problems

### Task B:

Solve the Dinner Planing Problem described in the attached file by modeling it as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and using the programming language of your choice.
Hint: search the web for implementations for CSP solvers in the language of your choice.

# Exercises 2: Cracking Passwords

- Compute the number of possible passwords for each system.
- Try to crack the passwords. If you do not succeed to crack one or several passwords, present your trials and explain why you didn't suceed (given the time constraint).

# Exercises 3: Modular Exponentiation

Implement the algorithm for modular exponentiation presented in the lecture and benchmark it against a built-in function of the language of your choice.

- Desired functionality: the number x = b^n mod m is computed
- Metrics: computation time and correctness of result (use WolframAlpha if in doubt)
- Benchmark-tasks:
  - 5^99 mod 11
  - 50^529 mod 13
  - 50^999 mod 17
  - a task of your choice
